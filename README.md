# SMSearch

## Description

Problem Statement: The lack of internet access among the majority of the population in sub-saharan africa builds barriers to accessing the net of information available.

Curiosity is the building ground of innovation and it is often paired with inquiry. We often google search for answers when curiosity
leads us to wonder. We want to provide students in sub-saharan parts of Africa with a platform to cultivate their curiosity and search for answers to their questions. Using SMS service, this app will take an inquiry as input and return the answer to the inquiry as a response, using a search engine
like google or yahoo.
